# Getting Started with Transfer Solution Project

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Notes

This project focuses on the front-end implementation. It uses the `coding-challenge.ts` file as its sole backend database. That means `CRUD` operations on nodes and edges do not perform as normal DB operations, i.e. data does not preserve after refreshing the browser. Once refreshing the browser, the nodes and edges will reverse to the original data from `coding-challenge.ts`.
